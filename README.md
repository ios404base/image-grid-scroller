# ImageGridScroller

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/images`.

## Approach

- Get the data from an external source and test if it works.
- Implement the UI that presents images.
- Implement the scroller.

## Things that can be improved

- Error handling
- Handle size of images in a better way
- Add tests

## Notes

- I used https://picsum.photos for external API since it was easier to configure. Used "author" instead of "title" and used "id" instead of "description" according to the API.
